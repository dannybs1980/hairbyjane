                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking at its layout.
                The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
                to
                using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                packages
                and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
                will
                uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
                by
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                ontrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin literature from
                45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
                in
                Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
                going
                through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
                comes
                from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                Cicero,
                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
                The
                first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The
                standard
                chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32
                and
                1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
                form,
                accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
